concrete methods and abstract methods

Interface

implements and extends

class A{
	public void func(int a){
		print(a)
	}
}

class B extends A{
	public void func(double a){
		print(a new)
	}
}

class MyClass{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		B obj = new B(); 
		obj.func(1); // func of class A is called 
		obj.func(1.2); // func of class B is called
	}
}


In an surface, a normal class cannot be declared as private or protected, if the programmer is 
interested to use it, it must define nested class. Again the nested class is divided into two
types :

	--> Inner classes 
	--> Static classes
